Fast & Furious


# SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

Along with the fast development of interconnected economy, modern-day traffic networks have become larger and more complex. Ineffective management of these traffic networks have multiple negative impacts on the individual as well as the national economy. 

The study aims to use machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost and LightGBM to predict the conditions at traffic bottlenecks such as highway tollgates to reduce congestion, enhance road usersâ€™ experience and improve infrastructure management. 

There are two main issues focused in this study, the first is to forecast the average traveling time through the tollgates and the second is to estimate the traffic volume at the tollgates.
