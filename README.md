# SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

Effective control and management of traffic flow becomes increasingly important nowadays. A good control system can only be built based on precise prediction and measurement of  traffic volume. Multiple factors, such as time of day and whether it is a holiday period, can play significant roles when people estimate the volume. Other factors, like weather conditions, are relevant, but it is difficult to measure their impacts. In this work, our team will apply different approaches to tackle the challenge of predicting traffic volume. Data used in experiments are provided by “Hanzhou Jiaotong & Amap” as part of KDD cup 2017 competition. The competition results are measured and ranked based on the “Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)” score of final proposals. The winning teams of this competition managed to get MAPE less than 13. Our team has selected the proposed solution from the 1st ranked team - Team：Convolution as our reference.
